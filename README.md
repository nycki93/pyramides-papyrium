- _martian-geometry.svg_. A print-and-cut template for the pieces (the pyramides papyrium) and the box (the pyramides papyrium pyxis).

## Printing the pieces

I printed these pieces on a black and white Brother multifunction home printer, and cut them on a Silhouette Portrait 1 from 2012. I got my Silhouette used on eBay from user allthingsassorted, and I hope its previous owner parted with it under good circumstances. This cutting robot is in great condition after 13 years and I hope to maintain it for many more.

I used a plugin called inkscape-silhouette, which as you might expect, is a plugin for inkscape, which allows you to control a Silhouette-brand cutting robot. The svg has a black square in one corner, and a right-angle in two other corners. These are necessary to center the Silhouette. If you are using a different cutter, please modify the file as appropriate.

There are three main patterns: Pyramid sheet one, pyramid sheet two, and box sheet three. Sheet one makes 1 small, 2 medium, and 1 large. Sheet two makes 2 small and 2 large. By alternating these two patterns you will get 4 trios for every 3 pages. Pretty good, right?

TODO: finish describing the construction of the pieces here.
